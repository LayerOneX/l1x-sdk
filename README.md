# L1X SDK

The L1X SDK is a Rust library designed to simplify the development of L1X smart contracts. Leveraging the eBPF runtime to execute smart contracts efficiently and securely.

Smart contracts in the L1X SDK follow Rust syntax and benefit from various macros and functions that facilitate seamless interactions with the L1X blockchain.

## Features

- 🚀 Native eBPF runtime support
- 🛠️ Rust-based smart contract development
- 🔒 Secure and efficient contract execution
- 🔌 Simple blockchain interaction APIs
